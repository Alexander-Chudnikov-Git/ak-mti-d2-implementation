# ak-mti-d2-implementation

## Overview
`ak-mti-d2-implementation` is a project focused on the implementation of the MTI (Message Transmission Infrastructure) protocol with support for elliptic curves. The project aims to deliver a reliable, secure, and efficient communication solution utilizing MTI/D2 protocols for message exchange.

## How to Use

This Part coming soon!

## Technologies We Use

### MTI Protocol
MTI (Message Transmission Infrastructure) is a modern protocol used for secure message transmission between systems. It leverages elliptic curve cryptography for enhanced security, providing robust encryption and efficient key exchange mechanisms. MTI ensures the integrity and confidentiality of transmitted messages, making it suitable for secure communications in distributed environments.

### D2
D2 is an additional layer or extension that works alongside the MTI protocol to improve the speed and efficiency of message handling. It optimizes the message transmission process, ensuring that messages are sent and received with minimal delay and maximum reliability.

## Libraries

This project uses the following library:

- **libakrypt**: A cryptographic library that provides the necessary cryptographic functions, including elliptic curve operations, that are utilized by the MTI/D2 protocol to ensure secure communication.
